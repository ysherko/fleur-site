<p><b>A small note on how AI Videos feature works:</b></p>
<p>
<ul><li>Fleur uses a Neural Network Model  that allows users to generate AI Videos from their photo.</li>
<li>Users upload 1 to 6 photos and select an effect from the Catalog.</li>
<li>Using these data, a GPT-image-1 and Neural Network models available in the Fal.AI service generate the AI Video.</li></ul></p>
<p>We do our best to moderate the settings of the AI model, however, it is still possible that you may encounter content that you may see as inappropriate for you.</p>
<p>We respect your privacy and are committed to protecting it through our compliance with this Privacy Policy. This Privacy Policy explains what we do with your Personal Data (as defined below) and allows you to manage your Personal Data effectively.</p>

<li>Comply with a legal obligation.</li>
<li>Make other internal and lawful uses of that information that are compatible with the context in which you provided it.</li></ul></p>
<p>3) Exercising Access, Data Portability, and Deletion Rights.

<p>You may only make a verifiable consumer request for access or data portability twice within a 12-month period. The verifiable consumer request must:</p>
<p><ul><li>Provide sufficient information that allows us to reasonably verify you are the person about whom we collected personal information or an authorized representative.</li>

<h3>7. Personal Information Sales Opt-Out and Opt-In Rights</h3>

Consumers who opt-in to personal information sales may opt-out of future sales at any time.
