<h1>Terms of Service</h1>

<h2>Welcome</h2>
<p>Welcome, and thank you for choosing Fleur as your go-to provider for cutting edge artificial intelligence software products and audio and visual alteration-enabled entertainment. We look forward to providing you with great services and products including our latest application, Fleur.</p>
<p>Fleur is a mobile application-based tool for applying various filters to photos and videos. Fleur is presently available through the Apple App Store, Google Play.</p>
<p>These Terms of Service (the "Terms of Service" / "ToS" / "Agreement") govern the use of the Fleur app ("Fleur" / "App") as well as the Fleur website fleurlab.ai (the "Website") and all services and products provided or otherwise made accessible through either of them (collectively "Services").</p>
<p>The Website and Services and all Content therein, are, unless otherwise designated, owned by Yuliya Reznik ("Fleur", "we" / "us" / "our"). These Terms of Service, together with any documents they expressly incorporate by reference, are a legally binding agreement governing our relationship with all Users and visitors of the Website and their use of any Content, functionality and Services offered by Fleur.</p>
<p>By Using the App, you affirm that you are of legal age to enter into these ToS. If you have any questions about these Terms of the Service or Fleur, please contact us via an email contact@fleurlab.ai (for additional contact information, please, see Section 19 of these Terms "Miscellaneous").</p>
<p><b>NOTE:</b> Fleur uses a Neural Network Model that allows users to generate personalized AI Videos (" AI Videos"). How does it work?</p> 
<p>
  <ul>
  <li>Fleur uses a Neural Network Model  that allows users to generate AI Videos from their photo.
<li>Users upload 1 to 6 photos and select an effect from the Catalog.
<li>Using these data, a GPT-image-1 and Neural Network models available in the Fal.AI service generate the AI Video.
<li>By using the App, Services or the Website, and via your click-through consent for the ToS, you accept and agree to abide by these Terms of Service and our Privacy Policy available at fleurlab.ai/privacy, which is incorporated herein by reference.
</ul>
</p>
<h2>1. Who We Are and What We Do</h2>
<p>WHAT WE ARE: Fleur develops and owns various software-based products and services including our most recent application-based product, Fleur, which is available through App Store and Google Play. Our suite of Services are intended to enhance User entertainment and customization experiences for User-generated audio and visual Content which they may then share and utilize throughout their social media and web-presences.
In addition to these ToS, all uses of Fleur, including purchases and downloads, are subject to the terms and conditions applicable to Apple App Store, Google Play and all Users must review and consent to those terms. As such, Users accessing or utilizing the Fleur application must have an active Apple App Store account in order to download and install Fleur and must maintain such account and abide by all applicable terms of service/use, privacy terms and other terms associated with such account.
For all 'free to use' versions of Fleur, our Users are not required to have a separate account with us, but certain paid premium features may require account establishment.
If you would like to use Fleur and any of its content for commercial purposes, you need to enter into a separate contract for commercial use with us.
Fleur is one of our Services and an application which allows Users to alter and enhance their own generated Content through the use of pre-fabricated video, photo and audio filters which we provide as built-in to the Fleur app as well as through our Services and Website otherwise.
In certain cases, filters which we provide to Users may also be 'sponsored' which means that they have been created by or in cooperation with one or more of our affiliates or strategic marketing partners, including, in certain cases, for the exchange of separate financial compensation. Where this applies, the given filters are notated on the User accessible features of the Website and Fleur as "Sponsored".
WHAT WE ARE NOT: Fleur is not a licensing or clearance agency nor are we a promotional entity for any other company. We are an independent developer and organization which creates and provides 'free to use' Content for Users to alter and enhance their own audio and video material for their own personal use thereafter. We do not require User payments for the accessing or use of the basic features of our Services and Content but in certain cases we may have premium features available which are usable and accessible upon paid subscriptions and/or singular purchase transactions. In addition, while these ToS do govern our Website, most of our Services, including Fleur, are exclusively available for usage-access as an application and accordingly, even if you consent to these ToS upon visiting our Website, you will still be required to confirm your consent to these ToS when downloading and accessing our App.</p>

<h2>2. Definitions</h2>

<h2>3. Minimum age requirement</h2>
<p>Our Services are not intended for individuals who are under 13 years old.

If you know anyone using the feature under the age of legal majority, please let us know promptly about it by contacting us at contact@fleurlab.ai. </p>

<h2>4. Subscriptions</h2>
<p>The Services of Fleur are primarily free to use and thus do not require subscriptions. However, in certain cases we may make some features available from time to time which will be on a paid-subscription basis as premium services. With respect to Fleur, these premium services may include additional features such as 'subscription only' filters, functionality to allow for the removal of Fleur watermarks from our applied filters, and superior processing and Content saving capabilities for applied and generated filters.
Unless specifically provided for otherwise in a signed writing by an authorized officer of Fleur, any and all subscriptions shall be available from the date of purchase on either a paid monthly or annual basis, or where available, for a one-time fee granting perpetual use (subject to our terms regarding termination), and shall constitute non-exclusive, revocable, non-sublicensable, licenses to access and use the Services and Content made available through such paid purchased subscription, subject to all rights, restrictions and terms stated herein, including the absolute right of Fleur to provide equivalent substitute Services as commercial practicability may require.
Except as otherwise specifically discussed herein,  paid Subscriptions shall not be sublicensable or resellable in any fashion.
Subscription pricing shall be posted and made available at the point of sale; specific pricing terms and scope of Services subscribed to, may be set by Fleur at the time of purchase by the concerned Subscriber and may be altered at any time as applicable to future payments due during any subscription period unless prepaid or guaranteed at a certain rate for a certain period of time. Payments for subscriptions are not refundable except in such case that upon subscription purchase, the premium Content and Services is never provided nor made accessible, in which case, the concerned purchasing User must abide by the procedures for obtaining a refund through the sales platform (App Store, etc.).For avoidance of any doubt, subscriptions purchased in the AppStore cannot be transferred to subscriptions on Google Play Store and vice versa.
Fleur can be used for commercial purposes only based on a separate agreement for commercial use.</p>

Failure to adhere to these commercial use conditions may result in immediate revocation of your commercial use rights, termination of your Business Plan subscription and/or disallowance of use of Fleur in general, and potential legal action.</p>
<h2>5. User Accounts</h2>

Both your original content and your edited or AI-generated content belong to you, and we claim no ownership over such content.
